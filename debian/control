Description: OpenPrinting printer support - database
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the printer database distributed by
 OpenPrinting for most common drivers.  You will probably need
 the foomatic-db-engine package for this package to be useful.
 .
 The foomatic-db-hpijs package adds additional printers supported by
 the HPIJS printer driver backend, particularly consumer inkjet
 printers from Hewlett-Packard.
 .
 The foomatic-db-gimp-print package adds additional printers supported
 by the GIMP-Print printer driver backend, most commonly used for
 color photo printing on consumer inkjets.
 .
 The foo2zjs package adds backend support for a number of printers
 from HP and Minolta/QMS that use the Zenographics ZjStream protocol.

Package: linuxprinting.org-ppds
Architecture: all
Depends: openprinting-ppds
Description: OpenPrinting printer support - PostScript PPD files
 This is a transitional package to migrate existing users of
 linuxprinting.org-ppds to openprinting-ppds (its
 successor).  It may be safely removed after upgrading.

Package: openprinting-ppds
Architecture: all
Suggests: cupsys, foomatic-filters-ppds, hplip-ppds
Replaces: linuxprinting.org-ppds
Provides: linuxprinting.org-ppds
Conflicts: hp-ppd (<= 0.5), linuxprinting.org-ppds
Description: OpenPrinting printer support - PostScript PPD files
 This package includes a collection of free PostScript Printer Description
 files for PostScript (and clone) printers from various manufacturers, as
 distributed by OpenPrinting.
 .
 If you have non-PostScript printers, the foomatic-filters-ppds and
 hplip-ppds packages are the ones you need; this package won't be of much
 help to you.
