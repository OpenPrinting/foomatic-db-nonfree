    Fortunately, Brother uses the same protocol for their host-based
    printers for many years and an appropriate driver is embedded in
    GhostScript, named "hl7x0". Unfortunately the driver was not
    updated for the additional options and resolutions of newer
    Brother printers, so that simply using the driver does only give
    very basic support for the current models (only 600 dpi, no
    Duplex, no tray selection, ...).&lt;p&gt;

    Recently &lt;a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hbp-for-brother"&gt;the
    Windows driver output of the newer models was
    investigated&lt;/a&gt; and it turned out that for the additional
    options only the appropriate commands need to be inserted at the
    beginning of the data stream.&lt;p&gt;

    On the mentioned site you find a PDF file with documentation about
    the options and a filter for inserting them into the output data
    stream of GhostScript. As probably many distributions will not
    include this filter, the Foomatic data and the resulting PPD files
    here fo all this work without needing the filter. So you only need
    the PPD from here and the GhostScript which comes with your
    distribution and you will have access to all resolutions including
    HQ1200 (2400x600 dpi), economy mode, media types, duplex, tray
    selection, and even password-protected printing (aka "Locked
    Print" or "Secured Print").&lt;p&gt;

    Note that not all settings are available on all printers,
    especially on older models. On some printers you will get a
    shifted page if you use a low resolution. Use 600 dpi in such a
    case. Please report everything on our Brother forum, so that we
    can exclude unsuitable settings from the PPDs.&lt;p&gt;

    With the "HQ1200" resolution setting the economy mode and duplex
    settings are ignored. You will always get one-sided printouts with
    standard toner density.&lt;p&gt;

    Try this driver also with PostScript and PCL printers from Brother
    (use simply a PPD file for a printer which is listed as supported
    by this driver). Do you get better/faster results or more
    functionality? Please report on the Brother forum.&lt;p&gt;

    If you have a monchrome laser from Brother which is not listed at
    all on the OpenPrinting site, start trying with this driver and
    report on the Brother forum.&lt;p&gt;
