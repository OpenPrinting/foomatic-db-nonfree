    Driver for the Canon LBP-810 and LBP-1120 laser
    winprinters. Should also work with other printers using the CAPT
    protocol, please report if you have a printer working with this
    driver which is not listed here.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that the driver talks directly to the USB port. So the
    printer must be connected via USB. The output destination
    specified in the printer spooler will not be used. If you use
    CUPS, set the destination to /dev/null, so that the CUPS backends
    do not block the USB device.&lt;p&gt;

    The Foomatic PPD files for this driver are not available on
    OpenPrinting because they are already contained in the driver
    package.&lt;p&gt;
