   The S400 and the BJC-3000 (nearly identical printers) are also
   supported by Gimp-Print, but with this driver the author did more
   fine-tuning on the colour curves. He has even written some small
   program for that (downloadable from the driver's web page). He
   claims that the quality is much better than the quality of
   Gimp-Print or even Windows. The driver is only tested on plain
   paper, reports about its quality on other papers and additional
   optimizations for other papers are welcome.&lt;P&gt;

   The printing system/execution information for this driver serves
   also for the s400b1.upp driver.
