        This is a driver developed for the Kyocera Mita FS-1016MFP
        laser printer.

        &lt;p&gt;
        
        It is possible that this driver will also work for other
        Kyocera Mita printers, but the author cannot test this.

        &lt;p&gt;

        Foomatic data to generate the PPD files is included with the
        driver, therefore we do not provide this data and PPDs here on
        the OpenPrinting site,
