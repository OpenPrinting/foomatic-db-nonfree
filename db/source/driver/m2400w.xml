	This is an open source driver developed for the
	Minolta magicolor 2400W color laser printer.&lt;p&gt;

        Foomatic execution data, and prefabricated PPD files, are
        included with the driver itself. Use those.&lt;p&gt;

	Note that both the "m2300w" and "m2400w" drivers are in one
	source code package.&lt;p&gt;
