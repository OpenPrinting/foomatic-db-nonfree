    <en>This printer though designed to 
be a Windows 95 printer can be tweeked to function usgin HP4 or HP5 PCL drivers under Linux

(Addendum: Samsung is using a &quot;high
speed printing&quot; protocol. Tweeking
this takes more than just tunelp.)
[ Ed: One fellow swears that it works, and two fellows can&apos;t get it going for the life of them.  Samsung appears to have sold exactly three of these; there are no reports on Usenet etc.  Caveat emptor! ]
(Ad: the original fellow did not actualy use the pinter, He&apos;s a former Samsung employee who thought the printer was an OEM HP3 Laser.)
 ***This printer has Windows-Only PCL 
&quot;emulation&quot; in the Windows driver. No hardware PCL support at all.  </en>
