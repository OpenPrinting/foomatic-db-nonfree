    <en>R. Wisenoeker has integrated a Z52 driver into &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=stp&quot;&gt;Gimp-Print&lt;/a&gt;. Please
    download Gimp-Print 4.1.99b1 or a CVS snapshot to get the
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    I have tested it with 2400x1200 dpi &quot;Highest Quality&quot;
    with photo cartridge, Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper and the
    CUPS drivr of Gimp-Print, Excellent result, and faster than the
    Epson Stylus Photo 1290, but slower than the lower
    resolutions. (Sep 2001). Perhaps the only winprinter which works
    &quot;Perfectly&quot; with free software.&lt;p&gt;

    The output quality with 1200x1200 dpi and the Gimp-Print CUPS
    driver (CVS from Feb 10, 2001) is excellent, but the printer is
    terribly slow with this resolution. Using 600x600 dpi makes the
    printing MUCH faster. To get images correct, you do not need to
    change anything with 1200 dpi, set Gamma to 0.5 (500 in CUPS)
    for 600 dpi and to 0.3 (300) for 300 dpi. The printout quality
    is MUCH better than with a recent HP DeskJet printer and
    Gimp-Print. The Linux/x86 binary driver provided by &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.lexmark.com&quot;&gt;Lexmark&lt;/a&gt; (as
    for the &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_printer.cgi?recnum=Lexmark-Z32&quot;&gt;Z32&lt;/a&gt;)
    is not needed.&lt;p&gt;

    If you still want to use the Lexmark driver, you can obtain it by
    simply following the &quot;Drivers&quot; link on the home
    page. The drivers issued by Lexmark do not contain any CUPS or PDQ
    configuration file, so use them either with LPD or with my &lt;a
    href=&quot;download/printing/lexmark-foomatic-kit.tar.gz&quot;&gt;Lexmark
    Foomatic Kit&lt;/a&gt;. Download it, uncompress it, and follow the
    instructions of its README file. Due to having access to all
    options of the driver it leads even to a better printout quality
    than the Lexmark driver with its original configuration
    software.&lt;p&gt;

    A specially modified variant of the pbm2l7k driver works,
    too (but not recommended, see above).&lt;p&gt;</en>
