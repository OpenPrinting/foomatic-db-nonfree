    PostScript version of the EPL-5900&lt;p&gt;

    Epson provides a free (LGPL) driver for this printer. With this
    the printer should work to its full extent.&lt;p&gt;

    Unfortunately, Epson&apos;s &quot;epl5900&quot; driver (or perhaps
    the printer&apos;s firmware) is somewhat buggy. It prints most
    documents, but images converted to PostScript with
    &quot;convert&quot; or by the built-in filters of CUPS leads often
    to incorrect printouts (stretched by a factor of 3 or 4 in
    horizontal direction). So it is recommended to use this printer in
    PostScript mode, uncompressed PPD files are on the CD delivered
    with the PostScript module, use the PPD files for Windows NT 4.0,
    they should work with all spoolers/applications under free
    OS.&lt;p&gt;

    Further tests with the &quot;pxlmono&quot; driver did not show
    this problem. The printer works perfectly in 1200 dpi with this
    driver, only full-page photos take very long to be
    rendered.&lt;p&gt;

    It is really strange that the native driver from Epson does not
    work correctly but a driver for an emulation mode.
