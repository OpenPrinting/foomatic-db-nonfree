    Multi-function device: Printer, Scanner, Copier.&lt;p&gt;

    In contrary to the CX5400 this device has memory card slots, so
    that you can print photos directly from your camera's card, but
    you can also scan documents or photos onto a memory card, for
    example for usage with a PDA.&lt;p&gt;

    The printing engine is compatible to the one of the Epson Stylus
    C84, see that printer entry for more info. All but full-bleed
    works with Gimp-Print 4.2.6 or newer or 4.3.24 or newer.&lt;p&gt;

    Scanning should work as described for the Epson Stylus CX3200 and
    CX5200, best with kernel 2.4.21 or later. To make the "epson"
    backend of &lt;a
    href="http://www.sane-project.org/"&gt;SANE&lt;/a&gt; recognizing
    this device, you have to add a line like&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;usb 0x4b8 0x805&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    to the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/sane.d/epson.conf&lt;/tt&gt; file where the
    two hexadecimal numbers are the vendor and product IDs of your
    scanner. You find the actual IDs in
    &lt;tt&gt;/proc/bus/usb/devices&lt;/tt&gt;. Search for an entry
    for an Epson device (the model name can be different to "CX6400"
    as often the Epson devices report their japanese market name) and
    in the line beginning with "&lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt;" directly above
    the line with the manufacturer name you find the hexadecimal
    vendor and product IDs.&lt;p&gt;

    Copying should just work with the front panel of the
    device.&lt;p&gt;
