    The Samsung CLP-300 is USB-only and the Samsung CLP-300N has a
    network connector.&lt;p&gt;

    This is a cheap color laser printer with a proprietary
    language. Samsung provides a closed-source driver on their web
    site, the "Unified Linux Driver", a driver package containing CUPS
    drivers and PPDs for all Samsung printers. Version 2.00.90 and
    newer supports also this printer. Output is raster-only, and due
    to glitches in the software, monochrome sources are output as
    color (visible flecks of cyan, magenta, and yellow). It is also
    not easy to install this driver in arbitrary distributions. See
    the user reports below in the &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_printer.cgi?recnum=Samsung-CLP-510&quot;&gt;entry
    for the CLP-510&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    As the first free software printer driver Rick Richardson's
    foo2qpdl supports this printer, but the driver still needs
    testing. So please try out this printer with SpliX and report your
    results to the author of the driver.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that this printer does not (yet) work with the SpliX. The
    support by the SpliX driver is still under development.&lt;p&gt;
