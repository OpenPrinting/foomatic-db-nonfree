    Multi-function device: Printer, Scanner, Copier.&lt;p&gt;

    The printing engine of this device is most probably the same as of
    the Epson Stylus Photo R300, for which basic support is available
    in Gimp-Print 5.0.x.  Fine tuning, testing, and support for
    printing on CDs still has to be done.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer has slots for all common types of flash memory
    cards. so one can print photos without PC direcly from the
    camera's card. The front panel has a graphical user interface
    which gives many options for printing from photo cards. Photo
    download works with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be
    simply mounted as a USB-mass-storage device then. You can also
    scan documents or photos onto a memory card, for example for usage
    with a PDA.&lt;p&gt;

    6-color CMYKcm printing, printing on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs
    possible (not yet supported by Gimp-Print).&lt;p&gt;

    Scanning should work as described for the Epson Stylus CX3200 and
    CX5200, best with kernel 2.4.21 or later. To make the "epson"
    backend of &lt;a
    href="http://www.sane-project.org/"&gt;SANE&lt;/a&gt; recognizing
    this device, you have to add a line like&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;usb 0x4b8 0x805&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    to the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/sane.d/epson.conf&lt;/tt&gt; file where the
    two hexadecimal numbers are the vendor and product IDs of your
    scanner. You find the actual IDs in
    &lt;tt&gt;/proc/bus/usb/devices&lt;/tt&gt;. Search for an entry
    for an Epson device (the model name can be different to "CX5400"
    as often the Epson devices report their japanese market name) and
    in the line beginning with "&lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt;" directly above
    the line with the manufacturer name you find the hexadecimal
    vendor and product IDs.&lt;p&gt;

    Copying should just work with the front panel of the
    device.&lt;p&gt;
