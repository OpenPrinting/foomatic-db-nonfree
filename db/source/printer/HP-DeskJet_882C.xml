    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hplip.sf.net/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplip.sf.net/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;

    To get its maximum quality, use the &quot;hpijs&quot;
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    Should work perfectly with the cdj880 driver; let us know (the
    author says, only for photos, not for text)!&lt;p&gt;

    I got a report from elenstev@mesatop.com that with the cdj880
    driver (in GS 5.50) this printer only works in draft and
    presentation quality, the normal quality does not work. RET on/off
    seems to have no effect for him. This bug does not appear any more
    in GNU GhostScript 6.51&lt;p&gt;

    Works well with hpdj/pcl3 at 300dpi.&lt;p&gt;

    Works OK at 600dpi with cdj850 driver, although colors are faded.
    &lt;p&gt;

    Brian, a Usenet contributor, is working with the hpdj/pcl3 author
    to improve support.&lt;p&gt;

    This is the same printer as the 880, with a retail box and idiot
    consumer software.&lt;p&gt;

    600dpi+ modes, and proper color modes are not documented by HP;
    reverse engineering efforts are not complete.
