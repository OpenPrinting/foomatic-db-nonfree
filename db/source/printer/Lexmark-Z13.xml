    Ultra-cheap (40$) inkjet printer, allows only to use one cartridge
    at a time, either 3-color (32$) or black (29$). Coming with only a
    colour cartridge and Lexmark cartridges being known to be
    expensive this printer is a very expensive solution in terms of
    the per-page cost. In addition probably the mechanics is very
    flimsy. I (Till) have the Z22 in my test rack and this model is
    already bad enough, and in addition, a simple calculation tells
    you that they sell you the mechanics for only 8 bucks, assuming
    that the cartridge coming with the printer is not a half-full
    starter cartridge. So one can even not recommend this printer to
    Windows users.&lt;p&gt;

    Unfortunately, there is no free software driver, but &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.lexmark.com&quot;&gt;Lexmark&lt;/a&gt;
    provides a Linux/x86 binary-only driver. To get it, simply follow
    the &quot;Drivers&quot; link on the home page. The drivers issued
    by Lexmark do not contain any CUPS or PDQ configuration file, so
    use them either with LPD or with my &lt;a
    href=&quot;download/printing/lexmark-foomatic-kit.tar.gz&quot;&gt;Lexmark
    Foomatic Kit&lt;/a&gt;. Download it, uncompress it, and follow the
    instructions of its README file. Due to having access to all
    options of the driver it leads even to a better printout quality
    than the Lexmark driver with its original configuration
    software.&lt;p&gt;

    There are unsubstantiated rumours that this printer does now work
    with one of the free Lexmark drivers.  If so do tell!
