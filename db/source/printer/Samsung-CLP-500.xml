    This is a cheap color laser printer with a proprietary
    language. Samsung provides a closed-source driver on their web
    site, the "Unified Linux Driver", a driver package containing CUPS
    drivers and PPDs for all Samsung printers. Version 2.00.90 and
    newer supports also this printer. Output is raster-only, and due
    to glitches in the software, monochrome sources are output as
    color (visible flecks of cyan, magenta, and yellow). It is also
    not easy to install this driver in arbitrary distributions. See
    the user reports below in the &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_printer.cgi?recnum=Samsung-CLP-510&quot;&gt;entry
    for the CLP-510&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    As the first free software printer driver SpliX supports this
    printer, but the driver still needs testing. So please try out
    this printer with SpliX and report your results to the author of
    the driver.&lt;p&gt;
