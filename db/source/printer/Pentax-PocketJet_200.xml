    Ultra-portable printer which weighs around one pound (513g) with
    battery. Its size is only 10.4in x 1.18in x 2.17in (255mm x 30mm x
    55mm). The printer is a direct thermal printer and so it needs
    special thermal paper. Pentax provides so-called &quot;Pentax
    Quality Paper&quot; which is much thicker and not so glossy as fax
    rolls, so one can probably use this printer even for
    correspondence. Due to the thermal printing the only moving part
    in it is the mechanics to advance the paper. this seems to be one
    important fact to get it so small.&lt;p&gt;

    The printer is not only intended to be used with notebook
    computers, but also with handhelds and PDAs. It has a parallel
    port built-in, serial adapter, and one gets USB and IR adapters
    and also a parallel cable as option, and drivers for handhelds and
    PDAs are available.&lt;p&gt;

    This 200-dpi model is made more for PDAs, there is also the
    PocketJet II with 300 dpi which is more suitable for
    notebooks.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer is light, but not a &quot;Paperweight&quot;. Rildo
    Pragana, the author of the &quot;ml85p&quot; driver (for the
    Samsung ML-85P laser winprinter), made a free software driver for
    this printer in cooperation with Pentax. So this you can really
    use this printer with your portable computer running a free
    operating system.
