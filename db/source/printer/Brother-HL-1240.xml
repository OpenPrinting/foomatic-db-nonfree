    In contrary to some of the user's comments below, this printer works
    well with the "hl1250" driver, a driver based on "ljet4" but preceeding
    the job with Brother-specific PJL commands, especially the one to set
    the resolution as shown below.&lt;p&gt;

    Brother provides a &lt;a
    href="http://solutions.brother.com/linux/"&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt;,
    too, but binary-only and only for LPD/LPRng. According to the
    printout quality it is based on the "ljet4" GhostScript
    driver. "pxlmono", "gimp-print" (600 dpi), and "hpijs" (600 dpi)
    give a better grayscale quality and all special features of the
    printer are accessible by PJL commands.&lt;p&gt;

    Old comments from users:&lt;p&gt;

    Roger (rogern at linuxfreemail dot com) reports that the
    &quot;hl1250&quot; driver works, but with incorrect
    margins.&lt;p&gt;

    Works great using the HP LaserJet 4/5/6 ("ljet4") driver and
    Ghostscript.&lt;br&gt;

    600dpi not supported via PCL alone, you must preface jobs with a
    PJL statement:&lt;p&gt;

    The easiest way to do this is by adding the following line to your
    printcap file:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;
    :ld=\033%-12345X@PJL\r\n@PJL SET RESOLUTION=600\r\n:&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/tt&gt;

    Otherwise, just send the following string to the printer befor you send
    the output of GhostScript:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;
    &amp;lt;ESC&amp;gt;%-12345X@PJL SET RESOLUTION=600&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/tt&gt;

    as well as selecting 600 dpi from the GhostScript command line.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer has 2MB memory, which cannot be extended; this may
    not be enough for all jobs at 600dpi. Until someone says
    otherwise, I want this printer to be marked imperfect because of
    this memory issue.&lt;p&gt;

    The above steps may not work if you have RedHat 6.0 or previous
    versions. I was able to get the printer working with an HP
    LaserJet driver and 300 dpi. 600dpi did not work well at
    all.&lt;p&gt;

    There&apos;s a &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.openprinting.org/pipermail/brother-list/2000q4/000040.html&quot;
    &gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; around the special driver for this
    printer; apparently it&apos;s got a bug of some sort. I guess the
    other drivers still work, but it&apos;s all a bit unclear right
    now.&lt;p&gt;
