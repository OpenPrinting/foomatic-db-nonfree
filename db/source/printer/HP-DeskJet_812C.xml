    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hplip.sf.net/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplip.sf.net/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;

    To get its maximum quality, use the &quot;hpijs&quot;
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    User report:&lt;p&gt;

    Colour resolution under Linux is 600x600 dpi. HP claims the
    Windows driver they ship with the printer enhances this using
    &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/all-in-one/products/1170-faqs.html#faq7&quot;&gt;&quot;PhotoRet
    II&quot;&lt;/a&gt; technology. The driver basically changes the
    amount of colors per dot by reducing the size of the
    inkdrops. Supposedly the inkdrops are 70% smaller per dot than
    those produced by the average DeskJet.  After checking their site,
    I found no driver to enable this same technology under any
    UNICES. Still, this should be a nice printer overall under Linux,
    so unleash that GIMP! This printer appears to be functionally
    identical to the DeskJet 810C. I am currently using the 300dpi
    DeskJet 550C colour GhostScript setup as shipped with Red Hat
    Linux 6.0, and the output is excellent in every respect. I have
    marked the suggested driver as cdj880 as I am 99.9% certain it
    will work and this driver should give the best output.
    &lt;p&gt;

    Good output should also be possible from the
    &quot;pcl3&quot;/&quot;hpdj&quot; drivers.&lt;p&gt;

    I believe that various papers like transparency, glossy, etc, are
    supported by one or the other &quot;cdjXXX&quot; driver.
