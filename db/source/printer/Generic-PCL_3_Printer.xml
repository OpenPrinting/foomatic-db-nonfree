    This entry allows you to use any printer which understands PCL 3
    with Foomatic, at least with the basic options. See your printer's
    manual to know whether your printer supports PCL 3.&lt;p&gt;

    Use it only for setting up your printer if your printer is not
    explicitly listed in the &lt;a
    href=&quot;printer_list.cgi&quot;&gt;Foomatic
    database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    If you use this entry to set up your printer, note that not all
    features of your printer will be supported and that the options
    offered to you do not all necessarily apply to your
    printer.&lt;p&gt;

    To set up your printer with the &quot;pcl3&quot; driver, it is
    recommended to apply the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;pcl3opts&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
    (comes with the &quot;pcl3&quot; driver) command to a file which
    you generate by printing into a file under Windows. The command
    shows you a list of options which brings you most closely to the
    mode in which the Windows driver has printed into the
    file.&lt;p&gt;
